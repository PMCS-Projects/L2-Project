## Overview

### Mission

On December 25th of 2021, NASA sent their most powerful space telescope thus far, the James Webb Telescope, to its new home in the second Earth-Sun LaGrange point. About a month later, it reached its destination, happily orbiting L2. That is, until – Oh no! There’s a loose bolt in the James Webb Telescope! NASA has mustered $10 billion to send a rocket carrying the needed supplies (1 wrench) to patch up the beloved JWT! 

We must draft a potential rocket design and code a 3D simulation for its flight to L2.
